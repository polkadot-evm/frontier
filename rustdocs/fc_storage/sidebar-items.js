This trait is quite similar to the runtime API, and indeed oe implementation of it uses the runtime API. Having this trait is useful because it allows optimized implementations that fetch data from a State Backend with some assumptions about pallet-ethereum’s storage schema. Using such an optimized implementation avoids spawning a runtime and the overhead associated with it."]]};
