# RPC Test Vectors — Status

Snapshot of the `fc-rpc-test-vectors` runner against
`frontier-template-node --dev`, baselined from CI run
`25330741253` against branch `manuel/add-rpc-test-vectors`.

The full skip list lives in
[`client/rpc-test-vectors/vendor-skip.txt`](../client/rpc-test-vectors/vendor-skip.txt).
This document is the human-readable companion: it groups skips into
buckets so a maintainer scanning the list knows which entries are noise
to be classified vs. real bugs to be filed.

## Headline

| Bucket | Count | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Match / SchemaOnly | 112 | passes |
| Excluded namespace | 4 | `testing_*`, `engine_*` (always skipped) |
| Skipped via `vendor-skip.txt` | 94 | failures grouped below |
| Real failures | 0 | should remain 0; new entries here are CI red |

`112 / (210 − 4) = 54%` of attempted vectors pass.

## Bucket 1 — methods Frontier does not implement (74)

These return JSON-RPC error -32601 (method not found) or a wire shape
Frontier doesn't produce. Whether any are *meant* to be implemented is a
roadmap question; this PR does not take that call. Candidates that are
unlikely to ever be in scope (because they reference Ethereum-specific
internals that don't translate to Substrate):

- `eth_blobBaseFee` — EIP-4844 blob fees; no blob sidecars on Substrate.
- `eth_getProof` — Merkle-Patricia state proofs; Substrate's storage
  trie is different.
- `eth_getStorageValues` — newer batched storage read; same trie issue.
- `debug_getRawBlock`, `debug_getRawHeader`, `debug_getRawReceipts` —
  return geth's RLP-encoded structures byte-for-byte.

Could go either way (real gap, but a Substrate impl is conceivable):

- `eth_simulateV1` (64 cases) — newer multi-call simulation API.

A future PR can promote the "never" set into `EXCLUDED_NAMESPACES` (with
per-method comments) and shrink this bucket.

## Bucket 2 — vectors hard-coded to Hive `chain.rlp` state (11)

These send a specific block hash, signed transaction, or contract call
that exists only in geth's Hive fixture chain. They cannot pass against
`frontier-template-node --dev` regardless of wire-format compatibility,
because the inputs reference state we don't have.

| Method/case | Why it can't pass |
|---|---|
| `eth_call/call-callenv-options-eip1559` | calls a contract from Hive chain.rlp |
| `eth_createAccessList/create-al-value-transfer` | references state from Hive chain.rlp |
| `eth_getBalance/get-balance-blockhash` | references blockHash from Hive chain.rlp |
| `eth_getBlockReceipts/get-block-receipts-by-hash` | references blockHash from Hive chain.rlp |
| `eth_getLogs/filter-with-blockHash` | references blockHash from Hive chain.rlp |
| `eth_getLogs/filter-with-blockHash-and-topics` | references blockHash from Hive chain.rlp |
| `eth_sendRawTransaction/*` (5 cases) | signed txs assume Hive chain nonces and keys |

Unlocking this bucket requires a way to seed Frontier from `chain.rlp`
(out of scope for this PR). Until then, these stay skipped.

## Bucket 3 — real Frontier wire-format gaps (9)

These vectors *should* be satisfiable on a dev chain, but Frontier's
response shape diverges from the spec. **These need issues filed** and
the entries removed from `vendor-skip.txt` as fixes land.

| Method/case | Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|---|
| `eth_getBlockByNumber/get-finalized` | `$.result.blobGasUsed` missing | Cancun blob fields not exposed |
| `eth_getBlockByNumber/get-latest`    | `$.result.blobGasUsed` missing | same |
| `eth_getBlockByNumber/get-safe`      | `$.result.blobGasUsed` missing | same |
| `eth_getBlockByNumber/get-genesis`   | `$.result.mixHash` missing | Substrate genesis omits `mixHash` |
| `eth_getLogs/filter-error-future-block-range` | `$.error` missing (returns result) | doesn't reject invalid ranges |
| `eth_getLogs/filter-error-reversed-block-range` | `$.error` missing (returns result) | same |
| `eth_call/call-revert-abi-error` | `$.error` missing (returns result) | revert-data not surfaced as JSON-RPC error |
| `eth_call/call-revert-abi-panic` | `$.error` missing (returns result) | same |
| `debug_getRawTransaction/get-invalid-hash` | `$.error` missing | different error shape on invalid hash |

## How to maintain `vendor-skip.txt`

- **Removing entries**: as a gap closes, delete its line. The next CI run
  against the affected method will then fail loudly if regressions
  reappear.
- **Adding entries**: each new entry needs a one-line reason. If the
  reason is "real bug", file the issue first and link it in the comment.
- **No globs**: case-level only. A new upstream vector for a
  not-implemented method should appear as a fresh failure so we notice
  and decide.
- **Bumping the submodule**: re-run the suite, then triage any new
  failures against the buckets above before adding them.
